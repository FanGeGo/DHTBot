Before running the examples in this folder, it is necessary to start
a dht daemon. The way to do this is:

    # Use this for a true daemon
    # The PID will be in twistd.pid
    # The log will be in twistd.log
    # All output will be redirected and the terminal will be freed
    twistd --python DHTBot/dhtbot/node.py

    
    # Use this to see the log output on the standard output screen
    # ctrl-c will then close the daemon
    # The terminal will captured and held until the daemon terminates
    twistd --nodaemon --python DHTBot/dhtbot/node.py


Note: the xml_rpc client examples are written using the
    default python implementation of xmlrpclib. Therefore,
    all code is blocking and incompatible with twisted
