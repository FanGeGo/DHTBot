direct_protocol contains examples that use the DHT protocol (written
with Twisted) directly

xml_rpc contains examples that use the xml_rpc/twistd wrapper around
the protocol and allows you to proxy queries through a long
running DHT daemon (this is the recommended way)

*Note: it is assumed that you are able to receive UDP response packets
Your firewall/router should be configured to support this
