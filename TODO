* In the krpc_sender.KRPC_Sender class, have it so that the protocol
    stores every transaction along with the address. (ie instead of looking
    up transactions just with the transaction_id, have it look up with
    both the transaction_id and the incoming/outgoing address).
* Have the Quarantiner bind into sendQuery so that it doesn't necessarily
    need to send its own querying pings. This way, the quarantiner
    can observe whether the jailed node responds to ANY outbound query
    giving it a higher chance of success
* Extend krpc_coder so that it includes optional attributes that are
    not part of the BEP specification (ie: include a krpc.optional_fields
    dictionary that contains additions for uTorrent adds)
