DHTBot
======
DHTBot is an MDHT client written entirely using the Twisted
networking libraries.


> Disclaimer: this will launch one MDHT node and one XML RPC Server
>   see dhtbot.node for more technical information

(** Quick Start **)

    1. Run ''' twistd -noy DHTBot/dhtbot/node.py ''' in one terminal.
    2. Run ''' python DHTBot/bin/start_client ''' in another terminal.
    3. In the client terminal: you can issue commands as such

        # Legend:
        #   k: an instance of dhtbot.xml_rpc.client.KRPC_Iterator_Client
        #   bootstrap_address: an address that can be used to send queries to

    >>> response = k.ping(bootstrap_address)

    or

    >>> nodes = k.find_iterate(some_target_id, nodes)

    4. Have fun :)

(** Recommended documentation **)

    * Methods that can be called on the node
    dhtbot.protocols.krpc_iterator  (most interesting)
    dhtbot.protocols.krpc_responder (more difficult, still interesting)
    dhtbot.protocols.krpc_sender (annoying, interesting for certain
        use cases)

    * Node: an MDHT identity, returned in some methods
    dhtbot.contact.Node

    * KRPC: the KRPC protocol message used within the MDHT network
    * returned from some methods
    dhtbot.krpc_types
