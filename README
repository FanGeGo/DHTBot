DHTBot
======
DHTBot is an MDHT client written entirely using the Twisted
networking libraries.

Work is in progress.

** Quick Start **

1. Run ''' twistd -noy DHTBot/dhtbot/node.py ''' in one terminal.
2. Run ''' python DHTBot/bin/start_client ''' in another terminal.
3. In the client terminal: you can issue commands as such

    # Legend:
    #   k: an instance of dhtbot.xml_rpc.client.KRPC_Iterator_Client

>>> response = k.ping(some_address)

or

>>> nodes = k.find_iterate(some_target_id, nodes)

4. Have fun :)

5. See dhtbot.protocols (krpc_iterator and krpc_responder are the easiest)
    for more methods that you can call on the node)
