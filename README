DHTBot
======
DHTBot is an MDHT client written entirely using the Twisted
networking libraries.

Work in progress.

> Disclaimer: this will launch one MDHT node and one XML RPC Server
>   see dhtbot.node for more technical information

** Quick Start **

1. Run ''' twistd -noy DHTBot/dhtbot/node.py ''' in one terminal.
2. Run ''' python DHTBot/bin/start_client ''' in another terminal.
3. In the client terminal: you can issue commands as such

    # Legend:
    #   k: an instance of dhtbot.xml_rpc.client.KRPC_Iterator_Client

>>> response = k.ping(some_address)

or

>>> nodes = k.find_iterate(some_target_id, nodes)

4. Have fun :)

(( Recommended documentation ))

    * Methods that can be called on the node
    dhtbot.protocols.krpc_iterator  (most interesting)
    dhtbot.protocols.krpc_responder (more difficult, still interesting)
    dhtbot.protocols.krpc_sender (annoying, interesting for certain
        use cases)

    * Node: an MDHT identity, returned in some methods
    dhtbot.contact.Node

    * KRPC: the KRPC protocol message used within the MDHT network
    * returned from some methods
    dhtbot.krpc_types
